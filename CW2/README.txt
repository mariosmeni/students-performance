Question 1.4 (Underperforming Students):
The criteria I used to find the underperforming students were:
- All the students who score less than 50% in the Summary Test
- I calculate the average of all the tests that a student had and kept only the students who's average was less than 50%
- I excluded all the students who didn't attempt more than 3 formative tests.
- In the end I create a new column which includes the minimum grade from all the formative tests of a student



The menu and GUI are in different files because I wanted to show both ways separately.
